# DevOps

This is a repository for myself to organize resources for DevOps.

## TL;DR
This is a centralized repo to link to other repos:
1. [local-docker](https://github.com/minixxie/local-docker) - for setting up docker environment on local machine. Good for development.
2. [infra-as-code](https://github.com/minixxie/infra-as-code) - IaC for creating infra-structures.
3. [k8s-services](https://github.com/minixxie/k8s-services) - mostly helm charts for installing softwares into k8s, and having ArgoCD to do GitOps.
4. [apps](https://github.com/minixxie/apps) - for ArgoCD GitOps to deploy applications.
5. [java-springboot](https://github.com/minixxie/java-springboot) - skeleton for Java Spring boot 3.
